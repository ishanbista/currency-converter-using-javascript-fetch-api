# Currency Converter using API
This is a simple currency converter website I made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website uses a Currency Converter API to convert the value of one currency (e.g., INR) to another (e.g., USD). It's a useful tool for quick currency conversion.

# Features

* Convert any currency to another (e.g., INR to USD, USD to EUR).<br>

* Enter the amount, select the currencies, and get the converted value instantly.<br>

* Includes multiple currencies, with real-time conversion rates fetched from the API.<br>
* Displays the result in the interface after conversion.

# Technologies Used

* CSS<br>
* JavaScript<br>
* Currency Convertor API<br>
